# RIOT Subsystem Maintainers

This file gives an overview about the maintainers of RIOT subsystems. Whenever
you submit an issue or a Pull Request, please assign one of the maintainers of
the affected modules as an assignee in the issue tracker. The maintainer takes
care of either fixing/merging the issue/PR herself or re-assign the issue to a
qualified developer.

**Note**: A developer might maintain more than one subsystem and an issue might
affect more than one module.
